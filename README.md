#### Why [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)?
A good single-page application should be maintainable, reliable, and efficient. Webpack is a powerful tool to build, because:
   * It manages modules and their dependencies and transforms static assets to build bundles
   * It creates the same build bundles in development and production for consistency
   * It controls multiple application entry points or sections, and provides common bundles among them. Other unique bundles for each section can be loaded on-demand.
   * It can version assets per file â€” for example, appending a unique hash to the file name (i.e. bundle.sd2fdds34.js). This makes it easy to cache the assets. It also supports live updates (hot module replacement) during development.

#### Why [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)?
Babel is a essentially an ECMAScript 6 to ECMAScript 5 compiler. It allows you to use ES6 features in your projects and then compiles ES5 for you to use in production.
